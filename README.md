# To-Do V2
An enchanced todo list app that allows users to create, move, update, and delete tasks from specific days of the week (as opposed to a long, unorganized task list), skyrocketing productivity and organization.

## Remaining Work
- Move completed tasks to a separate page.
- Allow completed tasks to be "undone" and brought back to the main page.
- Polish UI.

## Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Javascript
- Backend: Python (Flask mini-framework)
- Database: SQLite
